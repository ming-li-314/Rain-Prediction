# Rain-Prediction
Erdos Institute Deep Learning Course Project

The goal is to predict whether it rains or not in the next 6 hours using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN). The weather forecasting data is from ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) single-level hourly data. Only the months of January, February, March of 2025 have been used.
